# 🐍 100 Days of Python - Bootcamp Projects

This repository contains my journey through the **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023** taught by **Dr. Angela Yu** on Udemy.  

The bootcamp covers a wide range of Python applications, from basics to advanced concepts such as data science, web development, and automation.  
Each folder corresponds to a project I built during the course — one project per day for 100 days.
