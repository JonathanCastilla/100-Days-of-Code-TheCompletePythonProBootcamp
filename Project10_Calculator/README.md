# 🧮 Calculator (Python)

## 📌 Project Information
- **Project No.:** 10  
- **Project Name:** Calculator  
- **Author:** Jonathan Eduardo Castilla Zamora  

---

## 📝 Description
This project implements a **text-based calculator** in Python.  
It supports the four basic arithmetic operations: **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division**.  
The program allows the user to **chain calculations** by continuing with the previous result or to **start a new calculation**. Input validation is included to ensure only valid numbers and operations are accepted.

## ⚙️ Features
- Supports **addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/)**.  
- Allows chaining of calculations with previous results.  
- Input validation for numbers and operations.  
- ASCII art logo for enhanced visual presentation.  
- Console-clearing effect when starting a new calculation.

## 📖 Example Usage
```
🧮 Welcome to Calculator 🧮

What's the first number?: 10
+
-
*
/
Please, pick an operation. Type '+', '-', '*' or '/': *
What's the next number?: 5
10.0 * 5.0 = 50.0

Type 'y' to continue calculating with 50.0. Otherwise, type 'n' to start a new calculation: y
+
-
*
/
Please, pick an operation. Type '+', '-', '*' or '/': +
What's the next number?: 20
50.0 + 20.0 = 70.0

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**  
- Functions and dictionaries for operation handling  
- Input validation with error handling  
- Basic console interaction  

---

## 🌟 Learning Objectives
- Implement arithmetic operations as functions.  
- Use **dictionaries** to map symbols to functions dynamically.  
- Practice **loops**, **input validation**, and **conditional logic**.  
- Design an interactive console program with user-driven flow.
