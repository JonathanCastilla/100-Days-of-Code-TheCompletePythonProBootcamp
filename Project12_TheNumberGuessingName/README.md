# 🎮 Number Guessing Game

## 📘 Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a **text-based Number Guessing Game** developed in Python.  
The game challenges the player to correctly guess a number randomly generated by the computer between **1 and 100**.  
The program dynamically adjusts the difficulty by controlling the number of available attempts, and it provides interactive feedback to guide the player.

## 🎯 Game Description
- The computer generates a random integer between **1 and 100**.  
- The player selects a **difficulty level**:
  - **Easy** → 10 attempts available.  
  - **Hard** → 5 attempts available.  
- The player makes guesses, and after each attempt, the program indicates whether the guess was:
  - Too high 📈  
  - Too low 📉  
  - Correct ✅  
- The game ends when the player either:
  - Successfully guesses the number.  
  - Runs out of attempts.  
- At the end of each game, the player may choose to play again.

## ⚙️ Features
- **Random Number Generation:** Uses Python’s `random.randint()` to select the target number.  
- **Input Validation:** Ensures that:
  - Only positive integer guesses are accepted.  
  - Difficulty input must be either `easy` or `hard`.  
  - Replay input must be `y` (yes) or `n` (no).  
- **Difficulty Levels:** Adjusts the number of attempts based on the chosen mode.  
- **Replay Functionality:** Allows continuous play until the player decides to stop.  
- **User-Friendly Feedback:** Provides hints after each guess to help the player adjust their next attempt.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- **Python 3.x**  
- External module **art** (used for displaying ASCII logo).

## 🔍 Example Gameplay

```
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Choose a difficulty. Type 'easy' or 'hard': easy
You have 10 attempts remaining to guess the number.
Make a guess: 45
Your guess is too high.
You have 9 attempts remaining to guess the number.
Make a guess: 20
Your guess is too low.
You have 8 attempts remaining to guess the number.
Make a guess: 27
You got it! The number was: 27
Would you like to play again? Type (y/n):
