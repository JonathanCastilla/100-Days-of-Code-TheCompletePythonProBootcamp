Project Number: 14
Project Name: The Coffee Machine Program
Description:
    This program simulates a text-based coffee machine. The user can order
    one of three available drinks: espresso, latte, or cappuccino. The system
    checks if there are sufficient resources (water, milk, coffee) to prepare
    the selected drink. If resources are adequate, the user is prompted to insert
    coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies), from which the program calculates
    the total payment and verifies whether the amount is sufficient to cover the
    cost. If the transaction is successful, the drink is "served," resources are
    deducted, and change is provided if applicable. The user may also request a
    resources report to check the machineâ€™s current stock. The program continues
    running until it is manually terminated.
