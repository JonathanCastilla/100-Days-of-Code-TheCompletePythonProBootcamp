# 🔐 Caesar Cipher (Python)

This project implements a **text-based Caesar Cipher**, one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques.  
Each letter in the input message is shifted by a user-defined number of positions in the alphabet.  
The program allows both **encryption (encode)** and **decryption (decode)** and can be restarted multiple times within a single session.  

---

## 📌 Features
- Encode messages by shifting letters forward in the alphabet.
- Decode encrypted messages by shifting letters backward.
- Preserves spaces, punctuation, and non-alphabet characters.
- Input validation to ensure correct choices for encode/decode and restart.
- Interactive loop allowing multiple uses without restarting the program manually.
- Beginner-friendly implementation in Python.
