No. project: 9
Name project: Secret (Blind) Auction
Description: This program implements a text-based version of a secret (blind) auction.
             Multiple bidders can enter their names and bids without seeing othersâ€™ inputs.
             The program stores all bids in a dictionary and determines the highest bidder.
             At the end, it announces the winner with the highest bid.
