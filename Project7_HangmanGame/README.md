# ðŸŽ® Hangman Game (Python)

This is a **text-based Hangman game** implemented in Python.  
A random word is chosen from a predefined word list, and the player must guess letters within a limited number of lives. Each incorrect guess reduces the number of lives and updates the ASCII-art hangman drawing. The game ends when the player either guesses the full word (win) or runs out of lives (loss).

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Random word selection from a word list.
- ASCII art stages showing hangman progression.
- Tracks correctly guessed letters.
- Prevents repeated guesses.
- Win/Lose game outcomes with final word reveal.
- Beginner-friendly Python code.
